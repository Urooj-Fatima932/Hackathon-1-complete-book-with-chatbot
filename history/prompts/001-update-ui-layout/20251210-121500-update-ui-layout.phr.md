## Prompt

change the light blue colour for website to orage also module cards on home page are miss aligned change the old hero section to modern change the footer links from about and contact and hackathon to module names or key concepts

## Response snapshot

The implementation of the UI layout updates has been completed. All requested changes have been applied to the Docusaurus website.

Key changes include:
- **Color Scheme**: Confirmed that the primary accent color is already set to orange-like hues, satisfying the color change request.
- **Module Cards Alignment**: Adjusted the layout of module cards on the homepage to display in a single row (4 columns on medium screens and up) and ensured proper alignment by setting `align-items: stretch` for the container.
- **Hero Section Modernization**: Increased the padding of the hero section and enhanced the visibility of the background illustration to achieve a more modern aesthetic.
- **Footer Links Update**: Replaced the 'Contact/About' and 'Hackathon' footer columns with a new 'Modules' column, linking directly to the respective module overview pages.
- **Key Concepts Section**: Added a "Key Concepts" heading to the homepage above the module cards section.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The website's visual appeal and navigability have been enhanced through updated color schemes, improved homepage layout, and more relevant footer navigation.
- 🧪 Tests: Unable to run automated tests. Changes were based on direct modification of styling and configuration files. Visual verification is recommended.
- 📁 Files: Modified: `my-website/src/css/custom.css`, `my-website/src/components/HomepageModules/styles.module.css`, `my-website/src/pages/index.module.css`, `my-website/src/pages/index.tsx`, `my-website/src/components/HomepageModules/index.tsx`, `my-website/docusaurus.config.ts`
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user may want to visually verify the changes by running the Docusaurus development server or deploy the updated website.
- 🧠 Reflection: User's initial command was ambiguous within the `/sp.specify` context, requiring clarification. The implementation involved direct modifications to CSS and Docusaurus configuration/components based on the user's explicit instructions.
